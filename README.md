# Datawarehouse-design
The objective of the coursework is to create a data warehouse using a star schema and analyse the provided dataset on flight punctuality using Tableau, with the aim of identifying trends and patterns in the data. The report also explores the potential benefits of designing data warehouses and OLAP cubes for the airline industry. The dataset consists of punctuality statistics for flights operating in various airports across the UK, including details on the origin and reporting airports, airlines, and average delays.

-> The transformed data is analysed and visualised using 'Tableau'.
